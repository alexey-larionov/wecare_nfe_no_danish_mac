# Summary  

Perform SKAT-style data pre-processing and aggregation  
Preprocessing steps done in the following order:  

- Read and check bc8 data  
- *No need in inverting genotypes* because there is no variants with AFs > 0.5  
- Impute missed genotypes (2 x total AF = mean genotype, as "fixed" imputation in SKAT)  
- Weight variants by total AFs (dbeta[AF,1,25], default weight in SKAT, *assumes AF < 0.5* !!!)  
- Aggregate preprocessed (imputed-weighted) variants in bc8 genes (just summation: as in "burden" SKAT style)

# Impute missed data

Substitute NA with mean genotype per variant (= duplicated **total** AFs).  
Equivalent to the "fixed" imputation approach in SKAT (see impute.method parameter for SKAT function).  
Note: No AFs > 0.5 !!!

```{r}

# Check AFs
max(bc8_fiv_all.df$total_af)

# Prepare matrix for output
bc8_genotypes_imp.mx <- bc8_genotypes.mx

# Fraction of missed data 
sum(is.na(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx))
sum(is.na(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx))/
  (nrow(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx)*ncol(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx))

# Impute missed data
for(var in 1:nrow(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx)){

    # Get AF
    af <- bc8_fiv_all.df[var,"total_af"]
    
    # Impute missed genotypes
    genotypes <- bc8_genotypes_imp.mx[var,]
    2*af -> genotypes[is.na(genotypes)]
    genotypes -> bc8_genotypes_imp.mx[var,]

    # Clean-up
    rm(af, genotypes)
}

# Check the result
sum(is.na(bc8_genotypes_imp.mx))

     main="Histogram of genotypes\n(show only imputed and alts)")

# Clean-up
rm(var)

```

# Weight variants by af

Weight by **total** AF using dbeta(AF,1,25)  
Similar to the default weighting in SKAT  
(see parameter weights.beta=c[1,25] for SKAT function)  

```{r}

# Prepare tables for output
bc8_fiv_all.df <- data.frame(bc8_fiv_all.df, weight=NA)
bc8_genotypes_imp_wt.mx <- bc8_genotypes_imp.mx

# Apply weighting
for(var in 1:nrow(bc8_genotypes_imp_wt.mx)){
 
  # Calculate weight
  weight <- dbeta(bc8_fiv_all.df[var, "total_af"], 1, 25)
  
  # Write weight to variants table
  weight -> bc8_fiv_all.df[var,"weight"]
  
  # Apply weights to genotypes table
  weight * bc8_genotypes_imp.mx[var,] -> bc8_genotypes_imp_wt.mx[var,]
  
  # Clean-up
  rm(weight)

}

# clean-up
